# StreamDeck

A library for creating Stream Deck plugins in Swift. 

## Usage

Your plugin class should inherit from `StreamDeckPlugin`, which handles the WebSocket connection and events automatically. You can override event methods in order to act upon received actions.  

```swift
import StreamDeck

class CounterPlugin: StreamDeckPlugin {

    var counter: Int = 0
    
    override func keyDown(action: String, context: String, device: String, payload: KeyEvent) {
        counter += 1
        setTitle(in: context, to: "\(counter)")
    }
    
}
```

In order to run your plugin it needs to be registered during startup. The `PluginManager` manages the lifecycle of your plugin. In your `main.swift` file add your plugin:

```swift
import Foundation
import StreamDeck

PluginManager.main(plugin: CounterPlugin.self)
```

This is all that should be in the file in order for the Stream Deck software to successfully launch the plugin. 

## Responding to Events

When events are received by your plugin they are parsed and the corresponding method is called. See the [Events Received][er] page for more details. In order for your plugin to receive the event you need to override the method. 

- Note: You don't need to call `super` when overriding, any internal responses to events are handled automatically. 

Each method is called with the top-level properties along with an event specific payload. For instance, to the `keyDown` event provides a payload that includes the actions settings, coordinates, etc. 

You can override the following methods: 

- `willAppear(action:context:device:payload:)`
- `willDisappear(action:context:device:payload:)`
- `keyDown(action:context:device:payload:)`
- `keyUp(action:context:device:payload:)`
- `titleParametersDidChange(action:context:device:info:)`
- `deviceDidConnect(_:deviceInfo:)`
- `deviceDidDisconnect(_:)`
- `applicationDidLaunch(_:)`
- `applicationDidTerminate(_:)`
- `systemDidWakeUp()`

## Sending Events

In addition to receiving events from the application your plugin can [send events][se]. Most of the commands require a context object to specify the instance on the Stream Deck.

## Accessing Specific Action Instances

Responding to events is easy because the context is provided, however updating instances outside of a received event requires knowing the state of the Stream Deck. 

To aid in this the `StreamDeckPlugin` has an `InstanceManager` which tracks `willAppear` and `willDissapear` events. The manager provides methods for looking up available instances in a few ways. 

The most straight forward is by looking up the context token using `.instance(for:)`. Usually you'll be looking up instances of a specific action or at specific coordinates. 

To look up all instances of an action call `.instances(with:)`  with the UUID from your `manifest.json` file. The ID you pass in will be automatically lowercased. 

You can also look up the instance of an action by coordinates by calling `.instance(at:)`. 

The lookup methods return an `ActionInstance`, which provides the context, action ID, and coordinates of the instance. 

## Manifest Generation

Your plugin executable ships with an automatic way to generate the plugin's `manifest.json` file in a type-safe manor, similar to SwiftPM's `Package.swift`. 

```swift
let manifest = PluginManifest(name: "Counter",
                              description: "Count things. On your Stream Deck!",
                              author: "Emory Dunn",
                              icon: "counter",
                              version: "0.1",
                              os: [
                                    .mac(minimumVersion: "10.15")
                              ],
                              software: .minimumVersion("4.1"),
                              sdkVersion: 2,
                              codePath: "counter-plugin")

PluginManager.main(plugin: CounterPlugin.self, manifest: manifest)
```

To generate your manifest file, perhaps in an automated build, you need to use the `generate-manifest` command. This will output a pretty-printed manifest file you can use in your `.sdPlugin`.

```
counter-plugin generate-manifest --output /path/to/manifest.json
```

## Adding `StreamDeck` as a Dependency

To use the `StreamDeck` library in a SwiftPM project, 
add the following line to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(name: "StreamDeck", url: "https://github.com/emorydunn/StreamDeckPlugin.git", .branch("main"))
```

Finally, include `"StreamDeck"` as a dependency for your executable target:

```swift
let package = Package(
    // name, products, etc.
    platforms: [.macOS(.v10_15)],
    dependencies: [
        .package(name: "StreamDeck", url: "https://github.com/emorydunn/StreamDeckPlugin.git", .branch("main")),
        // other dependencies
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "<command-line-tool>", dependencies: [
            "StreamDeck"
        ]),
        // other targets
    ]
)
```
